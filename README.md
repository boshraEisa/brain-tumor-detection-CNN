# brain-tumor-detection-CNN
## CNN architecture used to classify MRI scans to whether or not a brain tumor is detected.

two deep learning techniques, VGG19 and Inception V3, are implemented on a brain tumour MRI dataset to classify the images into two categories: “tumour” and “no tumour”. 
The two approaches are implemented with and without data augmentation technique to further compare and contrast between the performances. 
The implementation phase resulted in the Inception V3 model with the augmented dataset scoring the highest performance with an accuracy score of 0.94 and a loss score of 0.1168.
